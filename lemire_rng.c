     * f: n -> n*range   -- maps [0, 2^32[ to the set of multiples of 'range' in [0, range*2^32[
     * g: m -> m / 2^32   -- cheap integer division via bit masking; maps [0, range*2^32[ to [0, range[
     * However, even if 'n' is uniformly distributed over [0, 2^32[, g(f(n)) is generally not uniformly distributed over [0, range[.
     * We have to do a little more work to preserve the uniformity.
     *
     * Here's how it works:
     * [0, range*2^32[ is divided into 'range' intervals of the form I(i) = [i * 2^32, (i+1) * 2^32[ (with 0 <= i < range)
     * Each I(i) interval is then subdivided in 2:
     *   R(i) = [i * 2^32, i * 2^32 + 2^32 % range[  -- possibly empty if 'range' is a power of 2
     *   A(i) = [i * 2^32 + 2^32 % range, (i+1) * 2^32[
     * Now, let's define the set U = { n in [0, 2^32[ such as f(n) is in not in any of the R(i) intervals }
     * The main result from Lemire is that if 'n' is uniformly distributed in U, then g(f(n)) is uniformly distributed in [0, range[.
     *
     * Building a uniform distribution on U is done by using a uniform distribution on [0, 2^32[, discarding integers n for which f(n) fall
     * into any of the R(i) intervals (rejection sampling, using the definition of U).
     * Note for the reader: for A(i) and R(i), 'A' is for 'Accept', and 'R' is for 'Reject'.
     * 
     * Given a random 32 bits number 'n', we decompose f(n) modulo 2^32, to do the rejection sampling:
     * f(n) = n*range = i*2^32 + j
     * where:
     *   i = n * range / 2^32 == g(f(n))
     *   j = n * range % 2^32
     */

    /* We have n*range == i * 2^32 + j
     *
     * This decomposition allows us to determine if f(n) falls in A(i) or in R(i), necessary to implement the rejection sampling.
     * f(n) being in R(i) is equivalent to j being in [0, 2^32 % range[
